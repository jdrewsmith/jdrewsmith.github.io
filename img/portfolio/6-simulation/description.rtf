\f0\fs24 \cf0 I worked with a group of professors to create an online simulation for technical writing students. I was involved in creating the entire experience and primarily responsible for designing the interface. We hoped to simulate the experience of a new intern at "Microcore," a fictitious biotech company. In the simulation, an internal catastrophe happens, and the interns are asked to investigate and communicate their finding in several written reports.}
