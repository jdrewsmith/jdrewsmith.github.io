                            <p>IBM is bringing Bluemix and SoftLayer, its two largest cloud platforms, together. They provide capabilities that enable enterprises to reinvent the way they develop software, but the experience of using both platforms is very difficult and disjointed. I have participated in several major projects related to this effort: First, creating a design system to unify the look and feel of the platforms; Second, facilitating workshops to promote Agile Development and IBM Design Thinking; Third, designing consistent security management for all IBM Cloud users.</p>

                              <p>As part of a guild of designers and front end developers, I had the opportunity to establish UI patterns for color, typography, iconography and interaction. In addition to brand considerations, we also worked to ensure that all patterns met accessibility standards.</p>
                              <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/1-cloud/designsystem.png" alt="">
                              <p>One of my contributions was advocating for a consistent type scale. A type scale adds consistency to the typography without being overly prescriptive to the designer. I created assets that designers could use in Sketch to reference the type scale in their designs. I also worked with the front end developers to implement that type scale as Sass variables to streamline implementation.</p>

                              <p>I also contributed patterns for the visual treatment and interactions of tables. Many cloud services, especially those in infrastructure, have extreme demands for tables. The final version of the table pattern was the result of collaborating with the designers of those services, and researching difficult areas like responsiveness.</p>

                              <p>During the three-month on-boarding program, I trained to become a Design Thinking facilitator. As a member of IBM Cloud, I have been asked several times to facilitate Design Thinking workshops and to facilitate planning workshops with offering management. This included a three-day planning workshop between Softlayer and Bluemix management teams. At the end of the workshop, I was asked to present the concepts that had been agreed upon to the senior membership.</p>

                              <p>As part of the core design team, I worked in several different areas but my focus was Security. The existing Security system was profoundly affected by the unification of SoftLayer and Bluemix. In addition to this enterprise cloud users are very sensitive to the security of their data, so there is a lot of pressure to experiences that instill confidence throughout the transition. In addition to the design work for the migration flows, my design lead and I worked with our Offering Manager to establish strategic user-centered goals for the project as a whole.<p>

                              <p>Above is an example of a wireframes deliverable. Thinking through and documenting the user flow is an important part of my process. It is often that during this stage that I realize that parts of the requirement need to be changed. The user flow is also a great artifact that can be shared with the product owner. For this flow, we created low fidelity wireframes that documented each necessary interaction that needs to be supported in the UI.</p>

                            <p>As a team we only had one week to design and code our vision so we divided into smaller teams based on our research findings. I worked with a couple developers and a designer on the Empathy section. We knew going in that it is difficult to make people to feel empathy. This is especially true for disabilities because many of us have no experience similar to that of those suffering from disabilities. <strong>What we came to realize is that by augmenting the computer inputs (mouse, keyboard), we could allow visitors to experience what it is like to use the web with a disability</strong>. Based on some early tests we found that users who experienced these simulations were often surprised by the difficulty and became much more supportive of accessibility efforts.<p>

                                <p>We started the design process by tracking down risk professionals and business owners and interviewing them about their positions. The users we spoke to verified that communication between the risk professionals and business owners was difficult. </p>

                                <h6 class="blue">Initial Concepts and Testing</h6>
                                <p>Based on this feedback and the research we did initially, we came up with three concepts. Each of concept takes a different approach to the problem and as we tested each one we discovered their strengths and weaknesses.</p>
                                <h4>Concept 1: Librarian</h4>
                                <p>Our first concept, titled "Librarian," was intended to encourage comparison of risk data to gather s into related metrics. This help some of the navigational problems that we heard about from risk professionals already using OpenPages but wasn't compelling enough to make business owners want to use the product.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/4-openpages/librarian.png" alt="">
                                <h4>Concept 2: Risk-o-Meter</h4>
                                <p>The "Risk-o-Meter" concept excelled in many of the ways that our first concept did not. Business Owners loved the idea of an aggregated view of risk that they could check frequently without needing to search for relevant information. They also loved that trends could be visualized. But this concept lacked some of the detail that would be necessary to influence decision making.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/4-openpages/riskometer.png" alt="">
                                <h4>Concept 3: Texting Plant</h4>
                                <p>"Texting Plant" may be an obscure name, but this concept was also well received. The premise of this concept was to minimize the amount of time that the business owner needed to spend in the application and automate the mundane tasks involved with risk management. But this concept lacked an overall understanding of risk exposure. This turned out to be a major shortfall of this concept.</p>

                                <h6 class="blue">Final Concept</h6>
                                <p>We pulled the best features of all of our previous concepts into our final, as well as some new insight into the way that business owners would like to view risk data. Business owners love to see the overall risk exposure of their business, but they also love to dissect that number. Risk Category, Line of Business, and Geography are their preferred breakdown of total risk exposure. We chose to make our concept a mobile application to make it always accessible to business owners.</p>

                                <p>In our application the business owner can view the different breakdowns and when they see something they would like to investigate further they cal select that column and see a further breakdown. They can also view a history of that category's risk exposure, and even compare those levels to the levels of actual loss events.</p>

                            <p>Design is a new force at IBM, but it's presence has had a huge impact on the rest of IBM as a company. People are often surprised to hear that IBM is embracing design to transform the culture of the business as a whole. They are especially surprised when they get the chance to visit and see the energy and ﬂair that make up IBM Design and the IBM Studios. We wanted to capture the essence of that energy and bring it to SXSW so that visitors could get a glimpse of what it is like to be a part of IBM Design.</p>

                              <p>I was asked to help be part of a planning committee for the first IBM Design Hive, an event that would highlight the culture of the IBM Design studios. As a committee we decided that <strong>the event should feature experiences that blended digital and analog technology</strong>. This is not only representative of IBM's history as a company, but also a reflection of the strong craft culture of our studio.</p>

                              <p>We started brainstorming the experiences we wanted to build into the event. From our inspirational images several themes started to emerge. <strong>Energetic, Unexpected, Continuous</strong>, and <strong>Immersive</strong> were some of the words that resonated with the vision we had for the event.</p>

                              <p>We also created a basic style guide that would help us maintain some consistency as we brought in more people to create the different parts of the event. The use of unfinished woods was to reflect the way that IBM's transformation to a modern software company is still unfinished. The colors play off the bee theme and the hand-done type is an unexpected element for those familiar with IBM products.</p>

                              <p>One of my main contributions to the final event was creating the idea and vision for the "Tweet on a Typewriter" experience. The concept drew from IBM's own history and played of the overall theme of blended analog and digital experiences. I worked with several engineers who took this concept and did the work to retrofit an IBM Selectric typewriter.</p>
                              <h4>Signage</h4>
                              <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/3-sxsw/sxsw-signage.png" alt="">
                              <p>I was also responsible for creating signage throughout the event. There were a wide variety of needs from directional signage, to informational displays, and maps and schedules. This role required a lot of collaboration because it affected all of the different groups working on experiences.</p>
                              <h4>Post-It Wall Construction</h4>

                              <p>I also helped coordinate volunteers that helped construct the venue during the day preceding the event. The largest effort I helped coordinate was the post-it wall construction. It took a team of about 5 almost 6 hours to place <strong>over 4,500 post-it notes</strong> on the wall! The wall would gradually create an analog heat map as visitors pulled from the wall to leave feedback throughout the event.</p>

                              <p>We brainstormed different ideas for addressing these pain points and then voted to determine the priority based on feasibility and importance. After the voting we decided that by combining three of the ideas we could start to address cover all of the pain points.</p>

                              <h4>Storyboarding</h4>
                              <p>To envision what a users experience might be once our solution was complete, we did a storyboarding exercise. This helped ensure that we were all in alignment around experience we wanted to deliver.</p>

                              <h4>Hypothesis</h4>
                              <p>We hypothesized that if we built an app that enables managers to conduct mini-pulse surveys and see the real-time feedback, the surveys could be more targeted, more employees would participate, and the feedback from the survey would be more actionable. To test this hypothesis we defined our MVP which we would build out and allow the client to pilot test.</p>

                              <p>A manager could quickly create a question and share a custom link out to the desired employees after a significant event or announcement.The manager could monitor results in real time and even get analysis and insights based on Watson Sentiment and Tone Analysis.</p>

                              <h4>Employees</h4>
                              <p>In our MVP, when an employee followed the unique link from their manager they see the question that the manager set and four emoji that represent Ver Sad, Sad, Happy, and Very Happy. The employee selects the one that best represents the way they feel, then they have the option of filling out a follow up question. When they submit their response they see an overview of all the other responses.</p>

                              <p>Our client was energized by the whole project and was so eager to test out the app that our sponsor sent out a survey to 70,000 employees, and the traffic initially crashed the app! But we quickly got it back online and our sposor described it as "addictive" and "like checking instagram." I am hoping to add a link to a demo version of this app, so check back again soon! </p>

                              <!--<h4>Brain fried? It's ok. We've been there too.</h4>-->
                              <p>Have you ever felt that there's something you should be doing but can't remember what it is? Or have you lost sleep because you could only to think about the things you need to do tomorrow? For me and a couple of my close friends this was happening to me way too often. It is easy to feel overwhelmed by all of the things to remember, tasks to do, and decisions to make everyday.</p>
                              <br>
                              <h4>Post-its only help so much.</h4>
                              <img class="img-responsive img-centered capheight" src="img/portfolio/9-brainhub/post-it.jpg" alt="">
                              <p>Despite trying dozens of productivity apps, the best system I had found for keeping up with everything was a system of post-its on my laptop, desk, and even phone. But this system took a lot of time to keep up and losing even one of the notes would throw the whole thing off.</p>
                            </div>
                              <h6 class="pink">Our Approach</h6>
                              <img class="img-responsive img-centered capheight" src="img/portfolio/9-brainhub/mascot-brushing-nobg.gif" alt="">
                              <!--<h4>What can you do about it?</h4>-->
                              <p>Like brushing your teeth, we think taking care of your attention should be a daily habit that helps you avoid more serious problems like burnout. Research suggests simple things like breaking large tasks down and planning when to accomplish tasks can help significantly. In making BrainHub, we focused on making those things easy and sustainable.</p>
                              <br>
                              <h4>Surveys and User Testing </h4>
                              <img class="img-responsive img-centered capheight" src="img/portfolio/9-brainhub/brainhub-quotes.png" alt="">
                              <p>I conducted user interviews and created several surveys to find out how people were handling this problem today. I also asked them to imagine an app that solved this problem, and describe what that app would do.</p>
                              <br>
                              <h4>Evolution of the Mobile Design </h4>
                              <img class="img-responsive img-centered capheight" src="img/portfolio/9-brainhub/brainhub-evolution.png" alt="">
                              <p>In my initial designs I thought back to my experience using post-it notes and sketched out an interface that mimicked the idea of a digital note for each day. I continued to refine the idea as I understood the interactions that would need to take place and got feedback on the designs from others.</p>
                              <br>
                              <h4>Emoji Signifiers</h4>
                              <img class="img-responsive img-centered capheight" src="img/portfolio/9-brainhub/graphic-emoji.png" alt="">
                              <p>I heard early feedback that entries were hard to tell apart when scanning through the feed. While exploring this problem, I came up with an idea to allow users to choose an emoji for each entry. This quickly turned into one of the most popular aspects of the design!</p>
                            <!-- Process -->
                              <br>
                              <h6 class="pink">Process</h6>
                              <img class="img-responsive img-centered capheight" src="img/portfolio/9-brainhub/mascot-experiment-nobg.gif" alt="">
                              <!--<h4>But we don't think it should stop there.</h4>-->
                              <p>As the designs took shape, my engineer built the the basic functionality and got it set up with the Apple TestFlight program so that we could all test it on our phones.</p>
                              <br>
                              <h4>Learnings from the Beta</h4>
                              <video width="320" height="500" controls>
                                <source src="img/portfolio/9-brainhub/brainhub-beta.mp4" type="video/mp4">

                              <p>There's no substitute for experience. The beta improved the way we managed our days, but it also raised lots of usability questions. Even more importantly, we got to see where and when we were using the application. This led to our decision to make a big change.</p>
                            <!-- Pivot -->
                              <br>
                              <h4>Platform Pivot</h4>

                              <p>Constantly checking your phone at work doesn't give the impression you're being productive. Also, checking your phone makes it easy to be distracted by another notification or app. We decided to pivot from building a mobile app first to a web app meant for a laptop.</p>
                            <!-- Outcome -->
                              <br>

                              <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/9-brainhub/brainhub-imac.gif" alt="">
                              <p>Designing for a new platform changes everything! I started a new design process using motion wireframes to get feedback on some of the transitions and interactions in the new desktop designs.</p>
                              <h4>One Entry at a Time.</h4>
                              <img class="img-responsive img-centered capheight" src="img/portfolio/9-brainhub/tasks-motion.gif" alt="">
                              <p>In my mobile designs I had anticipated taps, drags, and presses enabling much of the functionality but these interactions don't translate as well to a laptop. The action menu (show here) performed the best with our users and will enable us to dynamically change the options depending on the context.</p>

                                <p>From the beginning, we knew that data would be the key to helping people find the patterns that are difficult to recognize on your own. As we have focussed on enhancing the data captured in BrainHub and we've come to think about it in two categories: Implicit, and Explicit Data.</p>
                                <h4>Implicit Data</h4>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered capheight" src="img/portfolio/9-brainhub/brainhub-implicit.png" alt="">
                                <p>What days of the week are you the most productive? What things are you likely to procrastinate? Implicit data describes the context of all the actions you take within BrainHub and can help you answer questions like these. We are continuing to refine the implicit data we capture because you cannot recover this if it is not captured.</p>
                                <h4>Explicit Data</h4>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered capheight" src="img/portfolio/9-brainhub/brainhub-explicit.png" alt="">
                                <p>This data you track intentionally to explore an area of your life. We're adding support for a bunch of different data types (money, time, duration, value, etc) so that you can explore anything from your spending habits, to practice, hygiene, or any number of other areas of your life.</p>

It took hours to dig through the archives to choose right photos, but doing so enhanced the experience of writing about the events photographed.</p>

                              <p>Our article would also be following the release of an update to the IBM Design Thinking guidelines. Because our article would be making parallels between modern Design and Development processes and NASA's process, we decided to incorporate reference to the new guidelines into the design of the article itself.</p>

                              <p>My co-author and I designed and wrote the article at the same time. We did this because we wanted the design and the text to tell the story and to align the design element to what was being written about. As one of the featured articles in the issue, our article was intentionally in a longer format. It took us several iterations to refine text and the designs to complement each other, but the result was a thorough covering of the events that led to the man on the moon along with a vivid journey through the imagery of that moment in history.</p>

                                <p>When a hurricane hits Florida, a tornado rips through the Midwest, or any other catastrophe occurs, insurance companies send out field appraisers to process insurance claims. Responding to catastrophic events used to require a lot of manual planning to organize a large team of appraisers and ensure that those affected by the catastrophe were getting timely service. I helped facilitate a design workshop with our client (a large insurance company) to create a vision and plan for a new mobile application. This workshop resulted in an application that would improve appraiser's efficiency through a self-service on-demand experience.</p>

                                  <p>During our Design Thinking Workshop we brought together the entire team and the key stakeholders to decide as a group on how we could make an impact for our client and for catastrophic events. We dove into the problem space and identified the pain points that each user faced. We outlined a vision for how we wanted to improve the interaction between Field Appraiser and their coordinators. We came to a surprising idea: give the appraisers the ability to assign themselves to claims directly and take the coordinating manager out of the process.</p>

                                  <h4>Users</h4>
                                  <p>One of the most important parts of any Design Thinking workshop is aligning around who the users are. In our case there are two direct users, the catastrophic event filed Appraiser and a catastrophic event manager. These users have an impact on a third person, the company's clients, whose experience will ultimately be the measure of success. But for this application, the Appraisers and the Managers are the users to focus on. </p>
                                  <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/7-claimway/claimway-users.png" alt="">
                                  <h4>Pain Points and Vision - Appraiser</h4>
                                  <p>The biggest opportunity in our problem space was empowering the Appraisers. They are the boots on the ground after one of these events and the faster they are able to process claims, the faster the healing process can take place. By understanding the things that were holding them back we were able to craft a vision for how the application would improve their work.</p>
                                  <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/7-claimway/claimway-appraisers.png" alt="">
                                  <h4>Pain Points and Vision - Manager</h4>
                                  <p>The managers currently experience a lot of stress because of the deficiencies of the current system. Today, managing the routes of the adjusters takes the majority of their time, but an important part of their job is ensuring claimants receive service within their SLA. By empowering the appraisers to start to self-prioritize their claims, we enable the managers to focus on those effected.</p>

                                  <h4>Assumptions & Risk</h4>
                                  <p>Underlying our vision for this solution were many assumptions. As a group we discussed them and documented the three that we saw as having the biggest potential risk. For this project, we had assumptions related to the technology, market, and adoption that we wanted to test with our application.</p>
                                  <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/7-claimway/claimway-assumptions.png" alt="">
                                  <h4>Hypothesis</h4>
                                  <p>Finally to understand how we would measure the success of our application, we wrote a hypothesis. The discussion around metrics was interesting because each catastrophic event is so unique there are not a lot of standard measures. But in the end we align around three metric that should indicate that the application is providing significant business value.</p>

                                  <p>At the end of the workshop we took some time to visualize the solution that we had talked about. This was a great opportunity to get feedback quicky on the the direction we were headed and to clarify the expectations of our key stakeholders.</p>

                                  <h4>Sketching</h4>
                                  <p>As a group we worked on sketching out the screens associated with the vision we had outlined for each of the users. Though it is rarely comprehensive the sketches gave us a great place to start wireframing.</p>
                                  <img class="img-responsive img-centered" style="max-height:none" src="img/portfolio/7-claimway/claimway-sketches.png" alt="">
                                  <h4>Wireframing</h4>
                                  <p>Because this project would include two applications we spent some additional time to wireframe what the solution might look like in greater detail. This helped us solidify buy-in from our Client and accurately staff the project with developers.</p>
                                  <img class="img-responsive img-centered" style="max-height:none" src="img/portfolio/7-claimway/claimway-wireframes.png" alt="">

                                  <p>I continued to develop the designs throughout the project. As we learned the technical constraints of the technologies we were using and as we received feedback from our sponsor users and the client's brand team.</p>
                                  <img class="img-responsive img-centered" style="max-height:none" src="img/portfolio/7-claimway/claimway-hand.png" alt="">
                                  <h4>Process</h4>
                                  <p>To make gathering feedback and keeping track of changes easy, I created an Invision prototype that the client could access to gather feedback and leave comments on the designs. This allowed us to quickly iterate and adapt the designs as we went along.</p>
                                  <img class="img-responsive img-centered" style="max-height:none" src="img/portfolio/7-claimway/claimway-beforeafter.png" alt="">
                                  <h4>Mobile</h4>
                                  <p>The final mobile application was designed to be the go-to tool for appraisers. The could immediately see the appointments they had scheduled for the day when they logged in, and keep track of their daily performance goal. Other sections of the application included a section that showed all of the scheduled appointments with clients and a section that displayed the assigned claims from the manager. Finally, the appraiser had access to a map that showed them where the nearest claims were so that they could maximize their time in an area. The appraiser could drill down into and claim, and get the relevant information within the app as well.</p>

                                  <h4>Desktop</h4>
                                  <p>The desktop version of the application was built for the manager and allowed them so see across all of the members of their team, see what appointments they had scheduled, and make direct assignments for the claims that need immediate attention. The manager can also evaluate the overall progress of a CAT event and move their Appraisers around accordingly.</p>
                                  <img class="img-responsive img-centered" style="max-height:none" src="img/portfolio/7-claimway/claimway-desktop.png" alt="">

                                  <p>Our client piloted our application shortly after we finished development. The initial feedback they got was very positive! They are currently looking into training all of their appraisers to use the application and plan to use it during their catastrophe response across the country.</p>

                                    <p>As I designed the screens for my final concept it dawned on me that IBC's website functioned as their "elevator pitch" to potential customers. An elevator pitch has four distinct stages: <strong>Introduce yourself, Identify a problem, Describe your solution, and Invite / Engage the person to participate</strong>. These stages are reflected in my final designs. </p>
                                    <h4>Process Flow</h4>
                                    <p>IBC is a user-centered bank that has a history of caring for the community. When existing users lank on the website, they see a very clear CTA that will redirect them to their mobile banking dashboard. Users that do not already bank with IBC see highlights of their history of community involvement. Their long and established track record helps encourage trust. When a user decides that they would like to learn more they choose the type of banking they are interested in and get an experience catered to that type.</p>
                                    <h4>Wireframe Development</h4>
                                    <p>IBC knows that banking can be complex, because of that they have many features to make it easier. The user can see some of those conveniences here, and then choose the type of account they are interested in.</p>

For those unfamiliar with the differences in accounts, or for those simply looking for the best all around option, IBC has a recommended option. This makes it easy for the average user. More financially advanced users can read through the other options to determine if another option better fits their needs.</p>

                                    <h4>Stage 4: Invite / Engage</h4>
                                    <p>If the users is satisfied with their selections they can enter some personal information and an IBC representative will contact them to finish setting up the account! And just like that, IBC has added another member to their banking community. Today some information is available through their website but an interested customer would have to reach out through phone or email to even get started. This redesign would give the representative a headstart when creating new accounts, and provide the users with a more personalized and friendly experience.</p>

                                    <h4>Responsive for Desktop Users</h4>
                                    <p>Once I had the mobile experience finished I still had some time to consider the responsive behavior for desktop. Instead of a full screen change for each step, I envisioned that each step would be contained in a card. When the user made a selection the following card would appear but the user would stay on the same page and be able to go back and change their answer at any time.</p>

                                    <p>A final version of the desktop would require more time than the challenge allowed, but the mobile site functioned as the MVP. When I presented my work at the end of the challenge both the experience and the visual treatment was received very well.</p>

                                <p>As a designer I have always felt the best way to learn a new technique or software was to jump in and start using it. After getting early access to <b>InVision Studio</b>, a motion design tool, I created this project to teach myself the tool and develop my understanding on motion design.</p>

                                <p>I began with the idea to simply animate the liftoff stage of the Falcon Heavy rocket. But designing the rocket took me back the moment I watched the launch live and I decided to not only animate the liftoff, but all eight stages of the launch. Though challenging, the complexity of these eight steps gave me the opportunity to really explore the tool and its settings.<p>

                                  <p>To further challenge myself with this new tool, I added key details to the rocket, car, and starman. This also really enhanced the experience of viewing the animations. A few of my favorite details in this project were the rocket's plumes, and the car's hub caps. <p>

                                  <p>After sharing the video of my project, I got a great response on social media. The CEO of InVision along with many members of the team that created the Studio application responded with very positive reactions, and even reached out to get access to the working file so that they can use it to inform future development. I hope you enjoyed it too!<p>
