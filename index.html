                            <p>IBM is brought Bluemix and SoftLayer, its two largest cloud platforms, together to create IBM Cloud. This was a huge endeavor that would stretch over many months. My involvement was in a critical part that needed to get done first, identity migration.</p>

                              <p>Our team was responsible for the security services offered on the platform (Vulnerability Advisor, Key Protect) in addition to the core capabilities of the platform related to identity and access management.</p>

                              <blockquote>Users that used both Softlayer and Bluemix had a different identity (and login credentials) for each platform and frequently got them confused. <br><br> This caused many users to unecessarily reset their password or contact customer support.</blockquote>

                              <p>As we conducted user interviews, we realized that the way our users thought about their user identity varied depending on if they started out on one platform or the other. We also learned that the way each user accesses the platform and manages their identity was different. In order to address this, we decided to create separate experiences so that we met each group's expectations.</p>

                              <p>Once we had identified the problems faced by each of our users I planned and facilitated two workshops with our product manager for the two platform teams. As a team we came up with ideas about how to target groups of users and provide a way fot them to migrate to a new identity that would work for both platforms.</p>

                              <p> We found the most effective format for delivering designs to our teams was in a packet for a giving scenario. Each packet contained a diagram of the workflow, accompanying wireframes, and annotations throughout to describe the intended behavior. Ironically despite this whole initiative being about unification, the engineering teams requested different packets with their corresponding branding.<p>

                              <p>Several of the experiences had been implemented just before I moved on to a new role. Through these experiences almost 30% of the users would migrate to a new identity. <br><br> The biggest problem we ran into was that users would forget that they had migrated to a new ID.

                            <p>As part of my 3 months design bootcamp, I spent a week focussed on learning about accessibility in digital products. During this week we created a website that distilled important information for designers to design for accessibility. This website was build onto the existing IBM Design Language website.</p>

                            <p>We interviewed several designers and developers about their experiences with accessibility and we realized that depending on someone's domain maturity they had different needs. Someone with less maturity may see accessibility as a limiting factor or as an inconvenience. Someone with more maturity understands that meeting accessibility standards can help designers make a product that is easier for everyone to use.</p>

                            <p>As a team we only had one week to design and code our vision so we divided into smaller teams based on our research findings. I worked with a couple developers and a designer on the Empathy section. We knew going in that it is difficult to make people to feel empathy. This is especially true for disabilities because many of us have no experience similar to that of those suffering from disabilities. <strong>What we came to realize is that by augmenting the computer inputs (mouse, keyboard), we could allow visitors to experience what it is like to use the web with a disability</strong>. Based on some early tests we found that users who experienced these simulations were often surprised by the difficulty and became much more supportive of accessibility efforts.<p>

                                <p>Business owners typically work with a risk professional to assess the impact of business decisions on the business' risk exposure, but communication and coordination can be difficult. As a result, many business owners make decisions without the insight that could be gained from GRC data. Part of the problem is that OpenPages applications were built for risk professionals and are difficult for business owners to understand and utilize.</p>

                                <p>Based on this feedback and the research we did initially, we came up with three concepts. Each of concept takes a different approach to the problem and as we tested each one we discovered their strengths and weaknesses.</p>
                                <h4>Concept 1: Librarian</h4>
                                <p>Our first concept, titled "Librarian," was intended to encourage comparison of risk data to gather s into related metrics. This help some of the navigational problems that we heard about from risk professionals already using OpenPages but wasn't compelling enough to make business owners want to use the product.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/4-openpages/librarian.png" alt="">
                                <h4>Concept 2: Risk-o-Meter</h4>
                                <p>The "Risk-o-Meter" concept excelled in many of the ways that our first concept did not. Business Owners loved the idea of an aggregated view of risk that they could check frequently without needing to search for relevant information. They also loved that trends could be visualized. But this concept lacked some of the detail that would be necessary to influence decision making.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/4-openpages/riskometer.png" alt="">
                                <h4>Concept 3: Texting Plant</h4>
                                <p>"Texting Plant" may be an obscure name, but this concept was also well received. The premise of this concept was to minimize the amount of time that the business owner needed to spend in the application and automate the mundane tasks involved with risk management. But this concept lacked an overall understanding of risk exposure. This turned out to be a major shortfall of this concept.</p>

                                <p>We pulled the best features of all of our previous concepts into our final, as well as some new insight into the way that business owners would like to view risk data. Business owners love to see the overall risk exposure of their business, but they also love to dissect that number. Risk Category, Line of Business, and Geography are their preferred breakdown of total risk exposure. We chose to make our concept a mobile application to make it always accessible to business owners.</p>

                                <p>In our application the business owner can view the different breakdowns and when they see something they would like to investigate further they cal select that column and see a further breakdown. They can also view a history of that category's risk exposure, and even compare those levels to the levels of actual loss events.</p>

                            <p>Design is a new force at IBM, but it's presence has had a huge impact on the rest of IBM as a company. People are often surprised to hear that IBM is embracing design to transform the culture of the business as a whole. They are especially surprised when they get the chance to visit and see the energy and ﬂair that make up IBM Design and the IBM Studios. We wanted to capture the essence of that energy and bring it to SXSW so that visitors could get a glimpse of what it is like to be a part of IBM Design.</p>

                              <p>I was asked to help be part of a planning committee for the first IBM Design Hive, an event that would highlight the culture of the IBM Design studios. As a committee we decided that <strong>the event should feature experiences that blended digital and analog technology</strong>. This is not only representative of IBM's history as a company, but also a reflection of the strong craft culture of our studio.</p>

                              <p>We started brainstorming the experiences we wanted to build into the event. From our inspirational images several themes started to emerge. <strong>Energetic, Unexpected, Continuous</strong>, and <strong>Immersive</strong> were some of the words that resonated with the vision we had for the event.</p>
                              <figure>

                              <p>We also created a basic style guide that would help us maintain some consistency as we brought in more people to create the different parts of the event. The use of unfinished woods was to reflect the way that IBM's transformation to a modern software company is still unfinished. The colors play off the bee theme and the hand-done type is an unexpected element for those familiar with IBM products.</p>

                              <h4>Tweet On a Typewriter</h4>
                              <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/3-sxsw/sxsw-typewriter.png" alt="">
                              <p>One of my main contributions to the final event was creating the idea and vision for the "Tweet on a Typewriter" experience. The concept drew from IBM's own history and played of the overall theme of blended analog and digital experiences. I worked with several engineers who took this concept and did the work to retrofit an IBM Selectric typewriter.</p>
                              <h4>Signage</h4>
                              <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/3-sxsw/sxsw-signage.png" alt="">
                              <p>I was also responsible for creating signage throughout the event. There were a wide variety of needs from directional signage, to informational displays, and maps and schedules. This role required a lot of collaboration because it affected all of the different groups working on experiences.</p>
                              <h4>Post-It Wall Construction</h4>
                              <div class="row">

                              <p>I also helped coordinate volunteers that helped construct the venue during the day preceding the event. The largest effort I helped coordinate was the post-it wall construction. It took a team of about 5 almost 6 hours to place <strong>over 4,500 post-it notes</strong> on the wall! The wall would gradually create an analog heat map as visitors pulled from the wall to leave feedback throughout the event.</p>

                              <p>During our Design Thinking Workshop we identified users, pain points, and brainstormed what a solution would look like. Fifteen people attended the workshop which I facilitated with another designer. We dove into the problem space and helped our sponsor users identify three of biggest pain points that they face. They were: Timely feedback, making feedback actionable for managers, and collecting feedback again to validate you are making progress.</p>

                              <p>We brainstormed different ideas for addressing these pain points and then voted to determine the priority based on feasibility and importance. After the voting we decided that by combining three of the ideas we could start to address cover all of the pain points.</p>

                              <p>To envision what a users experience might be once our solution was complete, we did a storyboarding exercise. This helped ensure that we were all in alignment around experience we wanted to deliver.</p>

                              <p>We hypothesized that if we built an app that enables managers to conduct mini-pulse surveys and see the real-time feedback, the surveys could be more targeted, more employees would participate, and the feedback from the survey would be more actionable. To test this hypothesis we defined our MVP which we would build out and allow the client to pilot test.</p>

                              <p>A manager could quickly create a question and share a custom link out to the desired employees after a significant event or announcement.The manager could monitor results in real time and even get analysis and insights based on Watson Sentiment and Tone Analysis.</p>

The employee selects the one that best represents the way they feel, then they have the option of filling out a follow up question. When they submit their response they see an overview of all the other responses.</p>

But we quickly got it back online and our sposor described it as "addictive" and "like checking instagram." I am hoping to add a link to a demo version of this app, so check back again soon! </p>

                            <p>My close friend, a Software Engineer, and I wanted a better system for staying on top of our days and getting insight about our productivity. We couldn't find what we were looking for so we decided to build it. We call it BrainHub.</p>

                              <p>I conducted user interviews and created several surveys to find out how people were handling this problem today. I also asked them to imagine an app that solved this problem, and describe what that app would do.</p>

                              <img class="img-responsive img-centered capheight" src="img/portfolio/9-brainhub/mascot-brushing-nobg.gif" alt="">
                              <h4>Evolution of the Mobile Design </h4>
                              <img class="img-responsive img-centered capheight" src="img/portfolio/9-brainhub/brainhub-evolution.png" alt="">
                              <p>In my initial designs I thought back to my experience using post-it notes and sketched out an interface that mimicked the idea of a digital note for each day. I continued to refine the idea as I understood the interactions that would need to take place and got feedback on the designs from others.</p>
                              <br>
                              <h4>Emoji Signifiers</h4>
                              <img class="img-responsive img-centered capheight" src="img/portfolio/9-brainhub/graphic-emoji.png" alt="">
                              <p>I heard early feedback that entries were hard to tell apart when scanning through the feed. While exploring this problem, I came up with an idea to allow users to choose an emoji for each entry. This quickly turned into one of the most popular aspects of the design!</p>
                              <p>As the designs took shape, my engineer built the the basic functionality and got it set up with the Apple TestFlight program so that we could all test it on our phones.</p>
                              <br>
                              <h4>Dogfooding It</h4>
                              <iframe width="280" height="600" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tLDHc-wZTgI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                              <p>There's no substitute for experience. The beta improved the way we managed our days, but it also raised lots of usability questions. Even more importantly, we got to see where and when we were using the application. This led to our decision to make a big change.</p>
                            <!-- Pivot -->
                              <br>
                              <h4>Platform Pivot</h4>
                              <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/9-brainhub/brainhub-macbook.png" alt="">
                              <p>Constantly checking your phone at work doesn't give the impression you're being productive. Also, checking your phone makes it easy to be distracted by another notification or app. We decided to pivot from building a mobile app first to a web app meant for a laptop.</p>
                            <!-- Outcome -->
                              <br>
                              <h6 class="pink">Interaction Redesign</h6>
                              <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/9-brainhub/brainhub-imac.gif" alt="">
                              <p>Designing for a new platform changes everything! I started a new design process using motion wireframes to get feedback on some of the transitions and interactions in the new desktop designs.</p>
                              <h4>One Entry at a Time.</h4>
                              <img class="img-responsive img-centered capheight" src="img/portfolio/9-brainhub/tasks-motion.gif" alt="">
                              <p>In my mobile designs I had anticipated taps, drags, and presses enabling much of the functionality but these interactions don't translate as well to a laptop. The action menu (shown here) performed the best with our users and will enable us to dynamically change the options depending on the context.</p>

                                <p>From the beginning, we knew that data would be the key to helping people find the patterns that are difficult to recognize on your own. As we have focussed on enhancing the data captured in BrainHub and we've come to think about it in two categories: Implicit, and Explicit Data.</p>
                                <h4>Implicit Data</h4>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered capheight" src="img/portfolio/9-brainhub/brainhub-implicit.png" alt="">
                                <p>What days of the week are you the most productive? What things are you likely to procrastinate? Implicit data describes the context of all the actions you take within BrainHub and can help you answer questions like these. We are continuing to refine the implicit data we capture because you cannot recover this if it is not captured.</p>
                                <h4>Explicit Data</h4>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered capheight" src="img/portfolio/9-brainhub/brainhub-explicit.png" alt="">
                                <p>This data you track intentionally to explore an area of your life. We're adding support for a bunch of different data types (money, time, duration, value, etc) so that you can explore anything from your spending habits, to practice, hygiene, or any number of other areas of your life.</p>

                              <p>Just before we began working on this article, NASA released thousands of hi-res photographs from the Gemini and Apollo missions. My co-author and I were really inspired by these photographs and decided to use them to tell the story of our article. It took hours to dig through the archives to choose right photos, but doing so enhanced the experience of writing about the events photographed.</p>

                              <p>My co-author and I designed and wrote the article at the same time. We did this because we wanted the design and the text to tell the story and to align the design element to what was being written about. As one of the featured articles in the issue, our article was intentionally in a longer format. It took us several iterations to refine text and the designs to complement each other, but the result was a thorough covering of the events that led to the man on the moon along with a vivid journey through the imagery of that moment in history.</p>

                                <h4>Current Process</h4>
                                <p>In order to achieve this goal, we had to understand the existing process and what was causing the delay in the first place. I started by investigating the process through interviews and creating a service blueprint. This helped visualize the process and align the team.</p>

                                <p>In addition to documenting the process, we also conduct user interviews to understand our users better. By creating Empathy maps for each of the users we were targeting, we were able to document our understanding of our user's motivations and behaviors.</p>

                                <h4>#1 Coordinator Burnout</h4>
                                <p>From interviews with coordinators we discovered that burnout was a big problem. Coordinators don’t know which appraisals were completed until late in the evening. They often stay up late responding to changes and reworking the schedules and routes for the following day. The work is manual, and playing the part of the “middle man” is taxing. </p>

                                <h4>#2 Plans Change</h4>
                                <p>From interviews with appraisers we found that despite the hard work by the coordinators, claimants were frequently late or forgot their appointment entirely. Occasionally the appraisers would be stuck for hours with nothing to do. Since they’re away from home, this lack of efficiency frustrates the appraisers.</p>

                                  <h4>"Uber" for Appraisers</h4>
                                  <p>The problems we identified inspired a new hypothesis: If we could eliminate the need for coordinators as middle men, then we could help appraisers stay productive and service claimants faster. From a team “Big Ideas” brainstorm,  we came up with the idea to create a system that would automatically assign claimants to an Appraiser based on their location.</p>
                                  <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/7-claimway/claimway-wireframes.png" alt="">
                                  <h4>Initial Wireframes</h4>
                                  <p>My initial wireframes explored our big idea taking inspiration from similar eperiences in ride sharing applications.</p>
                                  <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/7-claimway/claimway-feedback.png" alt="">
                                  <h4>User Feedback</h4>
                                  <p>We shared initial wireframes with the appraisers and coordinators. The appraisers liked the idea of an Uber-like approach to assigning appraisers to claimants, but the coordinators had some significant concerns. Their feedback prompted us to rethink our design.</p>

                                  <p>As our users pointed out, automating the appraisal system based on location would not solve our key problem. In fact, it might exacerbate the problem for those claimants that live far from the place where the appraisers happen to stay.</p>

                                  <p>After the second set of user interviews, we realized that the key to eliminating the need for a middle man was empowering appraisers to manage their own routes.</p>

                                  <h4>Claimant Triage Workflow</h4>
                                  <p>One of the most important aspects for an appraiser to manage their own route is being able to adapt when claimants forget their appointments or cancel at the last minute.</p>

                                    <p>Going into the workshop, we had a general idea that there would be 4 unique users experiencing a complex, messy process. Activities like <strong>empathy maps</strong> helped align the team around the key users and their behaviors and motivations. Defining the <strong>As-Is Process</strong> (or current state journey), allowed each stakeholder to visualize the end-to-end process experienced by the key users.</p>

                                    <p>As I designed each component, I looked for opportunities for continuity. For example, the order progress indicator on the order overview page visually translates to the larger, more detailed progress indicator on the order detail page.</p>

The most common questions our users were looking to answer by using this tool were questions like <strong>"Where is my order?"</strong> or <strong>"When should I expect delivery?"</strong> This drove the order of information in each section and the order of each section on the page.</p>

                                    <p>In the first few weeks of testing the application it <strong>eliminated status inquiries!</strong> In addition to that both the IT Project Manager and the Data Center Manager mentioned that they used the application to plan better.</p>
                                    <h4>Challenges</h4>
                                    <p>While this tool was primarily designed for the supplier, his interactions with the tool directly impacted the other three users. Keeping track of everyone’s needs required frequent checkins with each of the other user groups.</p>

                                <p>As a designer I have always felt the best way to learn a new technique or software was to jump in and start using it. After getting early access to <b>InVision Studio</b>, a motion design tool, I created this project to teach myself the tool and develop my understanding on motion design.</p>

                                  <blockquote>"Crazy things can come true. When I see a rocket lift off, I see a thousand things that could not work, and it's amazing when they do." - Elon Musk about Falcon Heavy</blockquote>

                                <p>I began with the idea to simply animate the liftoff stage of the Falcon Heavy rocket. But designing the rocket took me back the moment I watched the launch live and I decided to not only animate the liftoff, but all eight stages of the launch. Though challenging, the complexity of these eight steps gave me the opportunity to really explore the tool and its settings.<p>

                                  <p>To further challenge myself with this new tool, I added key details to the rocket, car, and starman. This also really enhanced the experience of viewing the animations. A few of my favorite details in this project were the rocket's plumes, and the car's hub caps. <p>

                                  <p>After sharing the video of my project, I got a great response on social media. The CEO of InVision along with many members of the team that created the Studio application responded with very positive reactions, and even reached out to get access to the working file so that they can use it to inform future development. I hope you enjoyed it too!<p>
