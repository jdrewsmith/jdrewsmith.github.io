                            <h6 class="blue">How do you create a unified experience for all IBM Cloud Users?</h6>
                            <p>IBM is bringing Bluemix and SoftLayer, its two largest cloud platforms, together. They provide capabilities that enable enterprises to reinvent the way they develop software, but the experience of using both platforms is very difficult and disjointed. I have participated in several major projects related to this effort: First, creating a design system to unify the look and feel of the platforms; Second, fascilitating workshops to promote Agile Development and IBM Design Thinking; Third, designing consistent security management for all IBM Cloud users.</p>

                              <p>As part of a guild of designers and front end developers, I had the opportunity to establish UI patterns for color, typography, iconography and interaction. In addition to brand considerations, we also worked to ensure that all patterns met accessibility standards.</p>
                              <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/1-cloud/designsystem.png" alt="">
                              <p>One of my contributions was advocating for a consistent type scale. A type scale adds consistency to the typography without being overly perscriptive to the designer. I created assets that designers could use in Sketch to reference the type scale in their designs. I also worked with the front end developers to implement that type scale as Sass variables to streamline implementation.</p>

                              <p>I also contributed patterns for the visual treatment and interactions of tables. Many cloud services, especially those in infrastructure, have extreme demands for tables. The final version of the table pattern was the result of collaborating with the designers of those services, and researching difficult areas like responsiveness.</p>

                              <p>During the three month on-boarding program, I recieved training in Design Thinking fascilitation. As a member of IBM Cloud I have been asked several times to fascilitate Design Thinking workshops and to fasicilate planning workshops with offering management. This included a three-day planning workshop between Softlayer and Bluemix management teams. At the end of the workshop, I was asked to present the concepts that had been agreed upon to the senior membership.</p>

                              <p>As part of the core design team, I have worked on several different areas but my focus was in security. Security is profoundly effected by the unification of SoftLayer and Bluemix. Cloud users are very sensitive to the secuirty of their data, so there is a lot of pressure to experiences that instill confidence throughout the transistion. In addition to the design work for the migration flows, my design lead and I worked with our Offering Manager to establish strategic user-centered goals for the project as a whole.<p>

                              <p>Above is an example of a wireframes deliverable. Thinking through and documenting the user flow is an important part of my process. It is often that during this stage that I realize that parts of the requirement need to be changed. The user flow is also a great artifact that can be shared with the product owner. For this flow we created low fidelity wireframes that documented each necessary interaction that needs to be supported in the UI.</p>

                                <p>I worked on a team with a couple developers, visual designer and design researcher. As a team we did not have any previous experience with risk management. We set out to understand the domain and then to connect with the users who relied on OpenPages to do their job. The OpenPages team was looking to create a proof of concept application that would target the needs of business owners.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/4-openpages/userknowledge.png" alt="">
                                <p>Business owners typically work with a risk professional to assess the impact of business decisions on the business' risk exposure. Communication and coordination difficult and as a result many business owner's make decisions without insight that could be gained from GRC data. Part of the problem is that OpenPages applications were built for risk professionals and are difficult for business owners to understand and utilize.</p>

                                <h6 class="blue">Initial Conepts and Testing</h6>
                                <p>We started the design process by tracking down risk professionals and business owners and interviewing them about their positions. The users we spoke to verified that communication between the risk professionals and business owners was difficult. </p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/4-openpages/userinterview.png" alt="">
                                <p>Based on this feedback and the research we did initially, we came up with three conepts. Each of concept takes a different approach to the problem and as we tested each one we discovered their strengths and weaknesses.</p>
                                <h4>Concept 1: Librarian</h4>
                                <p>Our first concept, titled "Librarian," was intended to encorage comparrison of risk data to gather insights into related metrics. This help some of the navigational problems that we heard about from risk professionals already using OpenPages but wasn't compelling enough to make business owners want to use the product.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/4-openpages/librarian.png" alt="">
                                <h4>Concept 2: Risk-o-Meter</h4>
                                <p>The "Risk-o-Meter" concept excelled in many of the ways that our first concept did not. Business Owners loved the idea of an aggregated view of risk that they could check frequently without needing to search for relevany information. They also loved that trends could be visualized. But this cancept lacked some of the detail that would be necessary to influence decision making.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/4-openpages/riskometer.png" alt="">
                                <h4>Concept 3: Texting Plant</h4>
                                <p>"Texting Plant" may be an obscure name, but this concept was also well recieved. The premise of this concept was to minimize the amount of time that the business owner needed to spend in the application and automate the mundane tasks involved with risk management. But this concept lacked an overall understanding of risk exposure. This turned out to be a major shortfall of this concept.</p>

                                <p>We pulled the best features of all of our previous concepts into our final, as well as some new insight into the way that business owners would like to view risk data. Business owners love to see the overall risk exposure of their business, but they also love to disect that number. Risk Category, Line of Business, and Geography are their preferred breakdown of total risk exposure. We chose to make our concept a mobile application to make it always accessible to business owners.</p>

                                <p>In our application the business owner can view the different breakdowns and when they see something they would like to investigate further they cal select that column and see a further breakdown. They can also view a history of that category's risk exposure, and even compare those levels to the levels of actual loss events.</p>

                                <h4>Impromtu Interviews</h4>
                                <p>These interviews were very unstructed, but they still procuced some interesting insights. In addition to asking about their overall impression of the existing websites, I asked them to do some simple tasks like log in, or find the different checking account options.</p>

                                <h4>Competitive analysis</h4>
                                <p>Looking at other bank's websites proved to be very revealing. There was a huge spectrum from website that were completely broken in a narrow browser, to fully responsive sites that had a very refined design.</p>

                                <h4>Mobile First Design Approach</h4>
                                <p>I chose a mobile-first design approach because it helped me to focus on communicating the most important information. I made some rough sketches that documented the steps, and content I envisioned on the redesigned version of the website. I was also starting to explore potential layouts for each screen.</p>

                                <p>As I designed the screens for my final concept it dawned on me that IBC's website functioned as their "elevator pitch" to potential customers. An elevator pitch has four distinct stages: <strong>Introduce yourself, Identify a problem, Describe your solution, and Invite / Engage the person to participate</strong>. These stages are reflected in my final designs. </p>
                                <h4>Stage 1: Introduce Yourself</h4>
                                <p>IBC is a user-centered bank that has a history of caring for the community. When existing users lank on the website, they see a very clear CTA that will redirect them to their mobile banking dashboard. Users that do not already bank with IBC see highlights of their history of community involvement. Their long and established track record helps encourage trust. When a user decides that they would like to learn more they choose the type of banking they are interested in and get an experience catered to that type.</p>

                                <p>IBC knows that banking can be complex, because of that they have many features to make it easier. The user can see some of those conveniences here, and then choose the type of account they are interested in.</p>

                                <h4>Stage 3: Propose Solution</h4>
                                <p>IBC has different account options to match a variety of needs. For those unfamiliar with the differences in accounts, or for those simply looking for the best all around option, IBC has a recommended option. This makes it easy for the average user. More financially advanced users can read through the other options to determine if another option better fits their needs.</p>

                                <h4>Stage 4: Invite / Engage</h4>
                                <p>If the users is satisfied with their selections they can enter some personal information and an IBC representative will contact them to finish setting up the account! And just like that, IBC has added another member to their banking community. Today some information is available through their website but an interested customer would have to reach out through phone or email to even get started. This redesign would give the representative a headstart when creating new accounts, and provide the users with a more personalized and friendly experience.</p>

                                <h4>Responsive for Desktop Users</h4>
                                <p>Once I had the mobile experience finished I still had some time to consider the responsive behavior for desktop. Instead of a full screen change for each step, I envisioned that each step would be contained in a card. When the user made a selection the following card would appear but the user would stay on the same page and be able to go back and change their answer at any time.</p>

                                <p>A final version of the desktop would require more time than the challenge allowed, but the mobile site functioned as the MVP. When I presented my work at the end of the challenge both the experience and the visual treatment was received very well.</p>

                            <p>I worked with a group of professors to create an online simulation for technical writing students. I was involved in creating the entire experience and primarily responsible for designing the interface. We hoped to simulate the experience of a new intern at "Microcore," a fictitious biotech company. In the simulation, an internal catastrophe happens, and the interns are asked to investigate and communicate their finding in several written reports.</p>
